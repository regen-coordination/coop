# State Lane

- Only take work here when it clearly shrinks a current automation-hostile hotspot.
- Current candidates:
  - `packages/extension/src/views/Popup/hooks/usePopupOrchestration.ts`
  - `packages/extension/src/views/Sidepanel/tabs/NestTab.tsx`
  - `packages/shared/src/contracts/schema-agent.ts`
  - `packages/shared/src/modules/agent/agent.ts`
- Low-risk hygiene is also fair game when it has immediate payoff, for example tracked junk cleanup in touched areas.
- Do not reopen already-landed decomposition work from the archived source plan.
