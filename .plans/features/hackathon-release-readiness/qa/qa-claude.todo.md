# QA Pass 2

## Category

Testing, manual UX acceptance, and demo rehearsal.

## Focus

- user trust and clarity
- landing/install/docs sanity
- demo flow smoothness
- polish triage after the technical gate is green

## Tasks

- [ ] Walk the full story: landing -> install -> create or join -> passkey explanation -> pair
      device -> synthesize in Chickens -> invite/share -> archive/Filecoin -> Green Goods
      touchpoint.
- [ ] Check that privacy and local-first claims feel explicit and believable to a first-time user.
- [ ] Rehearse the demo flow and trim wording or sequencing friction where needed.
- [ ] Record only high-signal issues in `../eval/qa-report.md`, clearly separating blockers from
      nice-to-have polish.

## Verification

- [ ] Manual walkthrough completed
- [ ] Docs/install path sanity-checked
- [ ] Findings captured with a clear blocker vs polish split
