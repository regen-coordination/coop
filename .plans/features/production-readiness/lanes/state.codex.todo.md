# State Lane

- Clear release-gate blockers in this order:
  - fix lint violations and formatting drift
  - deflake the popup screenshot-review save test
  - broaden coverage to release-critical popup and sidepanel UI surfaces
  - rerun the staged-launch validation matrix until the result is binary
- Keep changes scoped to shipped release surfaces and validation integrity.
- Do not pull Claude into UI review until:
  - `bun format && bun lint` passes
  - targeted popup/app/sidepanel tests are green
  - `bun build` passes
  - `bun run validate:store-readiness` passes

## Current Result

- lint is green
- targeted test stability work is green
- release-critical coverage scope is now more honest
- staged launch remains blocked because the broadened coverage run lands at `77.29/76.41/77.57/77.29`, below the `85/85/85/70` gate
