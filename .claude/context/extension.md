# Extension Package Context

The extension is the primary product surface for Coop. It is a Chrome MV3 browser extension with a background service worker, popup, sidepanel, catalog, and offscreen document.

### Permissions

```json
["storage", "alarms", "tabs", "scripting", "sidePanel", "activeTab", "offscreen", "contextMenus", "notifications"]
```

Host permissions: `http://127.0.0.1/*`, `http://localhost/*`

Content script: `receiver-bridge.js` injected on `127.0.0.1` and `localhost` for receiver app communication.

Keyboard shortcuts: `Alt+Shift+Y` (open sidepanel), `Alt+Shift+U` (round up active tab), `Alt+Shift+S` (capture screenshot).

### Background Service Worker

`background.ts` (~740 lines) is the central orchestrator. It delegates to handler modules in `background/handlers/` for message processing and to `background/context.ts` for shared state management.

The background worker:

1. **Initializes** a `CoopDexie` database, loads auth session and sound preferences
2. **Manages coop state** in memory via Yjs documents (one per coop)
3. **Delegates runtime messages** to handler modules (`handlers/capture.ts`, `handlers/review.ts`, etc.)
4. **Runs passive capture** on alarm triggers and manual round-up
5. **Manages Yjs sync bindings** per coop (IndexedDB persistence + WebRTC providers)
6. **Manages receiver sync** for paired mobile devices (WebSocket relay connections)
7. **Controls extension icon state** (idle, watching, review-needed, error-offline)
8. **Handles archive operations** (Storacha upload with delegation flow)
9. **Plays sounds** via response metadata (views handle actual audio playback)

#### Handler Decomposition

Message handling is split across handler modules in `background/handlers/`:

| Module | Responsibilities |
|--------|-----------------|
| `capture.ts` | Tab capture, passive pipeline, screenshot, round-up |
| `review.ts` | Draft review, publish, mark-ready |
| `coop.ts` | Coop creation, join, profile updates, leave |
| `receiver.ts` | Receiver pairing, sync, intake ingestion |
| `agent.ts` | Agent cycle, plan approval/rejection, skill runs |
| `archive.ts` | Storacha upload, archive receipts |
| `session.ts` | Session capability issue/rotate/revoke |
| `permits.ts` | Execution permit issue/revoke/execute |
| `actions.ts` | Policy action propose/approve/reject/execute |
| `action-executors.ts` | Green Goods and delegated action execution |
| `member-account.ts` | Member onchain account provisioning |
| `heartbeat.ts` | Heartbeat / keep-alive |

#### Supporting Background Modules

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `context.ts` | Shared state (db, coop docs, settings, alarms, tab cache) |
| `dashboard.ts` | DashboardResponse assembly, popup snapshot, badge counts |
| `sidepanel.ts` | Sidepanel lifecycle management |
| `alarm-dispatch.ts` | Alarm event dispatch to appropriate handlers |
| `operator.ts` | Trusted-node / operator runtime logic |

Key state in the service worker:
- `coopDocs: Map<string, Y.Doc>` -- Live Yjs documents per coop
- `syncBindings: Map<string, SyncBinding>` -- WebRTC providers per coop
- `receiverRelayBindings` -- WebSocket relay connections for receiver sync
- `db: CoopDexie` -- Local database instance
- `authSession: AuthSession | null` -- Current passkey session
- `activeCoopId: string | undefined` -- Currently selected coop

### Runtime Message Bridge

All communication between views and background uses `chrome.runtime.sendMessage()`. The type system is a discriminated union:

```typescript
// In messages.ts
export type RuntimeRequest =
  | { type: 'get-dashboard' }
  | { type: 'create-coop'; payload: { ... } }
  | { type: 'manual-capture' }
  | { type: 'publish-draft'; payload: { draft, targetCoopIds } }
  | { type: 'join-coop'; payload: { inviteCode, displayName, ... } }
  // ... 40+ message types

export interface RuntimeActionResponse<T = unknown> {
  ok: boolean;
  data?: T;
  error?: string;
  soundEvent?: SoundEvent;
}
```

The response includes an optional `soundEvent` that the view plays via audio file playback after receiving the response. Sounds are never played in the service worker.

### View Architecture

**Popup** (`PopupApp.tsx`, ~88 lines): A full multi-screen app with bottom navigation. The popup is a thin shell that delegates all state to `usePopupOrchestration`. Screens are routed via `PopupScreenRouter`.

| Screen | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `home` | Quick-capture actions (round-up, screenshot, paste, note), status items, yard visualization |
| `drafts` | Draft/chicken list with filter tags, round-up trigger, share actions |
| `draft-detail` | Edit draft title/summary, toggle ready, share to coops |
| `feed` | Published artifact feed with filter tags, artifact dialog |
| `create` | Inline coop creation form (name, creator, purpose, starter note) |
| `join` | Inline coop join form (invite code, display name, starter note) |
| `profile` | Auth identity, coop list, sound/theme/agent preferences |
| `no-coop` | Empty state with create/join prompts (shown when no coops exist) |

Footer nav tabs: **Home**, **Chickens** (quick review), **Feed** -- with badge counts.

**Sidepanel** (`SidepanelApp.tsx`, ~174 lines): The full Coop workspace. A thin shell that delegates state to `useSidepanelOrchestration`. Tabs are routed via `SidepanelTabRouter`.

| Tab | Icon | Purpose |
|-----|------|---------|
| Roost | Rooster head | Green Goods member workspace: access state, member account provisioning, work submission |
| Chickens | Two eggs | Captured candidates, working drafts, filter popover, inference state, publish prep |
| Coops | Barn | Shared coop state, published artifact feed, archive, board link, coop switching |
| Nest | Bird nest | Trusted workspace: members, receiver, operator controls, delegation tools, settings |

The Nest tab is conditionally visible (only shown to users with trusted-node access). It groups the
member, receiver, agent, operator, archive, and settings controls behind three sub-tabs:
`members`, `agent`, and `settings`.

The sidepanel header includes actions for: pair device, toggle theme, open profile (via popup), close panel.

**Catalog** (`catalog/CatalogApp.tsx`): A standalone design token catalog surface showing colors, spacing, radii, and typography tokens. Built via `vite.catalog.config.ts` as a separate entry point.

### Operator Console

`OperatorConsole.tsx` provides a trusted-node operator panel with sections defined in `operator-sections/`:
- Agent memory and observations
- Knowledge skill management and skill manifest viewer
- Garden requests (Green Goods)
- Policy action queue
- Execution permits
- Session capabilities
- Trusted nest controls

### Service Worker Lifecycle

MV3 service workers are ephemeral. The background handles this by:
- Re-initializing state from Dexie on activation
- Using `chrome.alarms` for scheduled capture (not `setInterval`)
- Persisting coop state back to Dexie after mutations
- Reconnecting Yjs sync providers when the worker wakes

### Capture Flow

1. `chrome.alarms` or manual trigger fires
2. Background queries `chrome.tabs.query()` for all http/https tabs
3. For each tab, it calls `chrome.scripting.executeScript()` with `extractPageSnapshot()`
4. Results become `TabCandidate` records saved to Dexie
5. `runPassivePipeline()` processes candidates against all coops
6. Resulting `ReviewDraft` records are saved to Dexie
7. Extension icon updates to `review-needed` if drafts exist

### Agent Runtime

The extension hosts a local AI agent pipeline:
- `agent-harness.ts` orchestrates the agent execution loop
- `agent-runner.ts` runs skill pipelines with quality scoring
- `agent-registry.ts` discovers and loads registered skills
- `skill-markdown.ts` parses SKILL.md files for skill definitions
- `inference-worker.ts` runs inference via WebGPU/WASM in a WebWorker
- `agent-webllm-bridge.ts` bridges to WebLLM models
- Agent runs are triggered by alarm cadence or manual request

### Receiver Sync in Extension

The extension acts as the receiver sync consumer:
- `create-receiver-pairing` generates pairing payload + deep link
- `ingest-receiver-capture` validates HMAC-signed envelopes and saves captures
- Receiver sync uses WebSocket relay (not WebRTC) because the service worker lacks `RTCPeerConnection`
- An offscreen document (`receiver-sync-offscreen.ts`) handles WebRTC when needed

## Key Patterns

### All Logic in @coop/shared

The extension runtime is thin. All domain logic (coop creation, join, publish, archive, pipeline, review) lives in `@coop/shared`. The background worker orchestrates calls to shared functions and manages Chrome APIs.

```typescript
// Correct: import from shared, call in background
import { createCoop, saveCoopState, runPassivePipeline } from '@coop/shared';
```

### Message-First Architecture

Views never directly access Dexie or Yjs. Everything goes through runtime messages:

```typescript
// View sends message
const response = await sendRuntimeMessage({ type: 'create-coop', payload: { ... } });

// Background handles message, returns response
return { ok: true, data: state, soundEvent: 'coop-created' };
```

### Orchestration Hook Pattern

Both popup and sidepanel use a central orchestration hook that owns all state and actions:

```typescript
// Popup: usePopupOrchestration() -> PopupOrchestrationState
// Sidepanel: useSidepanelOrchestration() -> SidepanelOrchestration

// The app shell is a thin renderer:
function PopupApp() {
  const state = usePopupOrchestration();
  return <PopupShell><PopupScreenRouter state={state} /></PopupShell>;
}
```

Shared hooks (`useCaptureActions`, `useCoopActions`, `useQuickDraftActions`) are in `views/shared/` and used by both surfaces.

### Sound Events as Response Metadata

Sound events are returned as part of the runtime response, not triggered in background:

```typescript
// Background returns sound event
return { ok: true, soundEvent: 'coop-created' };

// View plays sound after receiving response
if (response.soundEvent) {
  await playCoopSound(response.soundEvent, soundPreferences);
}
```

Sounds are `.wav` files loaded from `public/audio/` (e.g., `coop-rooster-call.wav`, `coop-soft-cluck.wav`, `coop-squeaky-test.wav`). The `audio.ts` module maps `SoundEvent` types to file paths and volumes.

### Config Resolution

Environment variables are read via `import.meta.env.VITE_*` and resolved through `runtime/config.ts`:

- `VITE_COOP_CHAIN` -> `resolveConfiguredChain()` -> `'sepolia' | 'arbitrum'`
- `VITE_COOP_ONCHAIN_MODE` -> `resolveConfiguredOnchainMode()` -> `'mock' | 'live'`
- `VITE_COOP_ARCHIVE_MODE` -> `resolveConfiguredArchiveMode()` -> `'mock' | 'live'`
- `VITE_COOP_SIGNALING_URLS` -> `parseConfiguredSignalingUrls()` -> `string[] | undefined`
- `VITE_COOP_RECEIVER_APP_URL` -> `resolveReceiverAppUrl()` -> URL string
- `VITE_COOP_SESSION_MODE` -> `resolveConfiguredSessionMode()` -> `'mock' | 'live' | 'off'`
- `VITE_COOP_PROVIDER_MODE` -> `resolveConfiguredProviderMode()` -> `'standard' | 'kohaku'`
- `VITE_COOP_PRIVACY_MODE` -> `resolveConfiguredPrivacyMode()` -> `'off' | 'on'`
- `VITE_COOP_LOCAL_ENHANCEMENT` -> `isLocalEnhancementEnabled()` -> boolean
- `VITE_COOP_FVM_CHAIN` -> `resolveConfiguredFvmChain()` -> `'filecoin' | 'filecoin-calibration'`
- `VITE_COOP_ARCHIVE_GATEWAY_URL` -> `resolveArchiveGatewayUrl()` -> URL string
- Trusted-node archive config: `VITE_COOP_TRUSTED_NODE_ARCHIVE_*` (8 env vars)

### Dashboard Response

The `get-dashboard` message returns a comprehensive snapshot:

```typescript
interface DashboardResponse {
  coops: CoopSharedState[];
  activeCoopId?: string;
  drafts: ReviewDraft[];
  candidates: TabCandidate[];
  summary: RuntimeSummary;
  soundPreferences: SoundPreferences;
  uiPreferences: UiPreferences;
  authSession?: AuthSession | null;
  identities: LocalPasskeyIdentity[];
  receiverPairings: ReceiverPairingRecord[];
  receiverIntake: ReceiverCapture[];
  operator: OperatorDashboard;
  // ... additional fields for archive, permits, sessions, etc.
}
```

## Anti-Patterns

- **Never access Dexie directly from views**. Always go through runtime messages to the background.
- **Never play sounds in the service worker**. Return `soundEvent` and let the view handle audio.
- **Never use `setInterval` in the background**. Use `chrome.alarms` for scheduled work.
- **Never define domain logic in the extension**. Put it in `@coop/shared`.
- **Never assume the service worker is alive**. It may restart at any time; re-initialize from Dexie.
- **Never use `window` in the background**. It does not exist in a service worker context.
- **Never skip HMAC validation** on receiver sync envelopes.
- **Never put state management in the app shell**. Use orchestration hooks (`usePopupOrchestration`, `useSidepanelOrchestration`).
