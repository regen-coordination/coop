# Architecture Skill

Analyze the coop codebase architecture: map current state, identify structural gaps, and provide actionable improvement suggestions. Also a reference for design patterns and entropy reduction.

---

## Invocation

```
/architecture                          # Full analysis (all packages)
/architecture shared                   # Scope to one package
/architecture --focus boundaries       # Focus on a specific lens
/architecture --focus dependencies     # Dependency health only
/architecture --focus complexity       # Complexity hotspots only
```

---

## Analysis Workflow

When invoked as `/architecture`, execute these phases in order. Output findings as chat — do NOT edit files (read-only session).

### Phase 1: Structure Map

Build a current-state map of the codebase. For each package in scope:

1. **Module inventory** — list top-level modules/directories with a one-line purpose
2. **Export surface** — count public exports vs internal modules (barrel health)
3. **Dependency graph** — map which packages import from which, flag circular deps
4. **Size profile** — approximate line counts per module to spot bloat

Output as a table per package:

```
| Module | Purpose | Exports | Lines | Imports From |
|--------|---------|---------|-------|-------------|
```

### Phase 2: Boundary Analysis

Check module boundaries against Coop architecture principles:

1. **Import discipline** — flag any deep imports bypassing `@coop/shared` barrels
2. **Layer violations** — flag UI code in shared, business logic in components, framework code in domain
3. **Bounded context bleed** — flag modules reaching into other modules' internals
4. **Shared surface health** — are shared exports well-organized or becoming a junk drawer?

Severity: `violation` (must fix) | `smell` (should investigate) | `note` (worth knowing)

### Phase 3: Gap Analysis

Identify structural gaps — things that are missing or misaligned:

1. **Missing abstractions** — concrete dependencies where ports/adapters should exist
2. **Orphaned code** — modules with no importers or unclear purpose
3. **Inconsistent patterns** — same problem solved differently in different places
4. **Missing boundaries** — logic that should be separated but isn't
5. **Test coverage gaps** — modules with complex logic but no tests
6. **Documentation gaps** — public APIs without clear contracts

### Phase 4: Complexity Hotspots

Find the areas most likely to cause problems:

1. **High fan-in files** — files imported by many others (fragile change points)
2. **High fan-out files** — files importing many others (coupling magnets)
3. **Deep nesting** — modules with deep directory trees or call chains
4. **God modules** — files over 500 lines or modules doing too many things
5. **Churn candidates** — areas where the same patterns repeat (abstraction opportunities)

### Phase 5: Recommendations

Synthesize findings into prioritized, actionable suggestions:

| Priority | Category | Suggestion | Effort | Impact |
|----------|----------|-----------|--------|--------|
| P1 | ... | ... | S/M/L | ... |

Categories: `boundary`, `abstraction`, `deletion`, `consistency`, `testing`, `performance`

Effort: `S` (< 1 hour), `M` (half day), `L` (multi-day)

Group by theme. Lead with high-impact, low-effort wins. End with strategic suggestions that require planning.

### Phase 6: Architecture Scorecard

Rate the overall architecture health (1-5) across these dimensions:

| Dimension | Score | Trend | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|
| **Modularity** | ?/5 | ↑↓→ | Are boundaries clean? |
| **Cohesion** | ?/5 | ↑↓→ | Do modules have single responsibilities? |
| **Coupling** | ?/5 | ↑↓→ | Can modules change independently? |
| **Simplicity** | ?/5 | ↑↓→ | Is complexity justified? |
| **Consistency** | ?/5 | ↑↓→ | Same patterns everywhere? |
| **Testability** | ?/5 | ↑↓→ | Can you test without infrastructure? |

---

## Focus Modes

When `--focus` is specified, run only the relevant phase(s):

| Focus | Phases |
|-------|--------|
| `boundaries` | Phase 2 + Phase 6 (modularity, cohesion, coupling) |
| `dependencies` | Phase 1 (dependency graph) + Phase 2 (import discipline) |
| `complexity` | Phase 4 + Phase 5 (hotspots → recommendations) |
| `gaps` | Phase 3 + Phase 5 (gaps → recommendations) |
| `scorecard` | Phase 6 only (quick health check) |

---

## Execution Notes

- **Read-only**: This skill analyzes — it never edits files. Findings go to chat output.
- **Use subagents**: For full analysis across all packages, spawn Explore agents in parallel per package.
- **Respect scope**: When scoped to a package, only analyze that package and its immediate dependencies.
- **Be specific**: Every finding must reference a file path and line range. No vague observations.
- **Coop context**: Validate against the architecture defined in CLAUDE.md (local-first, passkey-first, browser-first, barrel imports, shared module location).

## Part 1: Reducing Entropy

### The Goal

**Less total code in the final codebase** - not less code to write right now.

- Writing 50 lines that delete 200 lines = net win
- Keeping 14 functions to avoid writing 2 = net loss
- "No churn" is not a goal. Less code is the goal.

**Measure the end state, not the effort.**

### Three Questions

#### 1. What's the smallest codebase that solves this?

Not "what's the smallest change" - what's the smallest *result*.

- Could this be 2 functions instead of 14?
- Could this be 0 functions (delete the feature)?
- What would we delete if we did this?

#### 2. Does the proposed change result in less total code?

```
Before: X lines
After: Y lines

If Y > X -> Question the change
If Y < X -> Good direction
```

#### 3. What can we delete?

Every change is an opportunity to delete:
- What does this make obsolete?
- What was only needed because of what we're replacing?
- What's the maximum we could remove?

### Red Flags

| Red Flag | Reality |
|----------|---------|
| "Keep what exists" | Status quo bias. The question is total code, not churn. |
| "This adds flexibility" | Flexibility for what? YAGNI. |
| "Better separation of concerns" | More files/functions = more code. Separation isn't free. |
| "Type safety" | Worth how many lines? Sometimes runtime checks win. |
| "Easier to understand" | 14 things are not easier than 2 things. |

### Prioritization

When trade-offs arise: **Maintainability > Speed > Brevity**

Protect the existing architecture over shipping fast.

## Part 2: The Cathedral Test

Before writing code, run this mental checklist. Hold the "cathedral" (system architecture) in mind while laying this "brick" (specific change).

### 1. What Cathedral Am I Building?

Identify the system-level design this change supports:

| Domain | Coop Cathedral | Key Pattern |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| **Local data** | Dexie for structured persistence | `useLiveQuery` for reactive reads |
| **Sync** | Yjs CRDTs + y-webrtc | `Y.Doc` per coop, rooms per session |
| **State management** | Zustand with granular selectors | Never `(s) => s`, always specific fields |
| **Auth** | Passkey-first, Safe-based identity | `useAuth` from shared, never local |
| **Module location** | ALL shared logic in `@coop/shared` | Never define hooks in app/extension |
| **Onchain** | Safe + ERC-4337 via viem/permissionless | Mock/live mode via env var |

**Ask**: "Which cathedral does this change belong to?"

### 2. Does This Brick Fit?

Find the most similar existing file and verify alignment:

| Check | Example Reference |
|-------|-------------------|
| Naming conventions | `useCoopMembers` -> `use[Domain][Action]` |
| Error handling | Categorized errors, user-friendly messages |
| State updates | Dexie writes or Zustand actions |
| Sync handling | Yjs doc updates, room lifecycle |
| Import structure | `import { x } from '@coop/shared'` |

**Reference file**: [identify the closest existing implementation]

### 3. Hidden Global Costs?

Check architectural rules:

| Rule | Check | Fix |
|------|-------|-----|
| **Timer Cleanup** | Raw setTimeout/setInterval? | Use cleanup in useEffect |
| **Event Listeners** | Missing removeEventListener? | Use `{ once: true }` or cleanup |
| **Async Mount Guard** | Async in useEffect without guard? | Use isMounted pattern |
| **Zustand Selectors** | `(s) => s` pattern? | Never `(s) => s`, use granular selectors |
| **Dexie Reactivity** | Manual polling for DB changes? | Use `useLiveQuery` |
| **Chained useMemo** | useMemo depending on useMemo? | Combine into single |
| **Context Values** | Inline object in Provider value? | Wrap in useMemo |

**Additional checks**:
- [ ] Does this break local-first guarantee?
- [ ] Is this duplicating logic in `@coop/shared`?
- [ ] Does this work offline?

### 4. Explain Non-Obvious Violations

When you spot a **non-obvious** violation:
1. Explain the principle being violated
2. Then suggest the fix

*For obvious violations (missing cleanup, hardcoded addresses), the fix is self-explanatory.*

## Part 3: Design Patterns

### Clean Architecture (Uncle Bob)

**Layers (dependencies point inward):**

```
+---------------------------------------------+
|           Frameworks & Drivers              |  <- UI, Database, External
+---------------------------------------------+
|           Interface Adapters                |  <- Controllers, Gateways
+---------------------------------------------+
|              Use Cases                      |  <- Application Logic
+---------------------------------------------+
|              Entities                        |  <- Business Rules
+---------------------------------------------+
```

**Key Principles:**
- Dependencies point inward only
- Inner layers independent of outer layers
- Business logic framework-agnostic
- Testable without external infrastructure

### Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)

```typescript
// Port (interface)
interface ArchiveGateway {
  upload(content: Uint8Array, meta: ArchiveMeta): Promise<ArchiveResult>;
}

// Adapter (implementation)
class StorachaAdapter implements ArchiveGateway {
  async upload(content: Uint8Array, meta: ArchiveMeta): Promise<ArchiveResult> {
    return storachaClient.upload(content, meta);
  }
}

// Domain uses port, not adapter
class PublishService {
  constructor(private archive: ArchiveGateway) {}

  async publishDraft(draft: Draft): Promise<void> {
    await this.archive.upload(draft.content, draft.meta);
  }
}
```

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

**Tactical Patterns:**

```typescript
// Value Object (immutable, validated)
class InviteCode {
  constructor(readonly code: string) {
    if (code.length < 6) throw new Error("Invite code too short");
  }
}

// Entity (identity-based)
class Coop {
  constructor(
    readonly safeAddress: Address,  // Identity
    private name: string,
    private members: Member[]
  ) {}

  addMember(member: Member): void {
    this.members.push(member);
  }
}

// Aggregate Root (consistency boundary)
class Draft {
  publish(author: Member): void {
    if (this.status !== DraftStatus.Ready) {
      throw new Error("Can only publish ready drafts");
    }
    this.status = DraftStatus.Published;
  }
}
```

---

## Part 4: Coop Application

### Current Architecture

| Pattern | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Ports** | `@coop/shared` interfaces |
| **Adapters** | Package-specific implementations |
| **Bounded Contexts** | `extension` (browser experience), `app` (receiver/landing) |
| **Persistence** | Dexie tables + Yjs documents |

### When Adding Features

1. **Define the domain entity** in `shared/src/types/`
2. **Create port interface** in `shared/src/modules/` or `shared/src/hooks/`
3. **Implement adapter** using existing infrastructure
4. **Keep business logic** in domain, not UI

### Directory Structure

**Current structure** (`packages/shared/src/`):

```
+-- flows/            # XState state machines
+-- hooks/            # React hooks
+-- modules/          # Business logic modules (auth, coop, storage, archive, onchain)
+-- providers/        # React context providers
+-- stores/           # Zustand state stores
+-- types/            # TypeScript type definitions
```

> **Note:** Domain entities are defined in `types/`. Imports should use `@coop/shared` barrel exports.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem |
|--------------|---------|
| **Anemic Domain** | Entities with only data, no behavior |
| **Framework Coupling** | Business logic knows about browser APIs |
| **Fat Controllers** | Business logic in React components |
| **Missing Abstractions** | Concrete dependencies everywhere |
| **Over-Engineering** | DDD for simple CRUD operations |

---

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Dependencies point inward** — UI depends on domain, never reverse
2. **Small interfaces** — Interface segregation
3. **Domain logic separate** — No framework code in entities
4. **Test without infrastructure** — Mock adapters, test domain
5. **Bounded contexts** — Clear boundaries between domains
6. **Ubiquitous language** — Same terms in code and conversation
7. **Bias toward deletion** — Measure the end state
8. **Rich domain models** — Behavior with data
