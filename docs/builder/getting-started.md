# Getting Started

This page is the builder onramp for the whole monorepo, not only the extension.

## Builder Downloads

- [Latest builder build](https://github.com/greenpill-dev-guild/coop/releases/tag/builder-latest)
- [Install guide](/builder/getting-started#quick-install-extension-only)
- [All releases](https://github.com/greenpill-dev-guild/coop/releases)

The rolling `builder-latest` prerelease is updated from successful merges to `main`. Stable tagged
releases remain available on the main GitHub Releases page when you want a versioned artifact.

## Quick Install (Extension Only)

If you want the packaged extension without cloning the repo:

1. Download the latest builder build from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/greenpill-dev-guild/coop/releases/tag/builder-latest)
2. Unzip `coop-extension-builder-latest.zip` into a local folder
3. Open `chrome://extensions`
4. Turn on **Developer mode** (top-right toggle)
5. Click **Load unpacked**
6. Select the unzipped folder containing `manifest.json`
7. Pin the extension and open the sidepanel

That path is the fastest way to install the freshest builder build from GitHub.

If you want to build the extension locally from source instead:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/greenpill-dev-guild/coop.git
cd coop
bun install
cd packages/extension && bun run build
```

Then load the extension in Chrome:

1. Open `chrome://extensions`
2. Turn on **Developer mode** (top-right toggle)
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select the folder `packages/extension/dist/chrome-mv3`
5. Pin the extension and open the sidepanel

That is enough to explore the popup, sidepanel, and local mock workflows. Rebuild with `bun run build` after code changes and reload the extension in Chrome.

For the full install path, zip distribution, and Chrome Web Store details, see
[Extension Install & Distribution](/reference/extension-install-and-distribution).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22 from the repo's `.mise.toml`
- Bun for workspace installs and scripts
- Chrome or Chromium for extension development
- an optional phone or second device if you want to test the receiver flow

Recommended toolchain bootstrap:

```bash
mise install
eval "$(mise activate zsh)"
node -v
```

`node -v` should report `v22.x` before you run the docs commands. If your shell still resolves an
older Node first, `bun run docs:build` can fail even though the repo has a Bun workspace.

## Bootstrap The Repo

Run these commands from the repository root:

```bash
bun install
bun dev
```

Useful split commands:

```bash
bun dev:app
bun dev:extension
bun dev:api
```

## Keep One Root Environment File

The repo uses one root `.env.local`. Do not create package-local env files.

Typical local defaults:

```bash
VITE_COOP_CHAIN=sepolia
VITE_COOP_ONCHAIN_MODE=mock
VITE_COOP_ARCHIVE_MODE=mock
VITE_COOP_SESSION_MODE=off
VITE_COOP_RECEIVER_APP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3001
VITE_COOP_SIGNALING_URLS=ws://127.0.0.1:4444
```

For the full variable reference, see [Environment Reference](/builder/environment).

## Core Packages

| Package | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `@coop/shared` | Shared contracts, modules, storage, policy, sync, archive, identity |
| `@coop/app` | Landing plus receiver PWA shell |
| `@coop/extension` | MV3 extension runtime and primary product surface |
| `@coop/api` | Signaling relay plus Yjs WebSocket sync routes |
| `@coop/docs` | This Docusaurus site |

## Running The Docs Site

Use the root workspace scripts so the docs app picks up the repo's shared toolchain:

```bash
bun run docs:dev
bun run docs:build
bun run docs:serve
```

`bun run docs:build` writes generated output to `docs/build`. Treat that directory as generated
output, not canonical source content.

If docs builds fail with an older Node version, activate `mise` in the current shell and retry:

```bash
eval "$(mise activate zsh)"
node -v
bun run docs:build
```

## Development Tools

**UI Catalog** -- Preview design tokens (palette, spacing, radii, shadows) in light and dark themes.
Run with `bunx vite --config packages/extension/vite.catalog.config.ts` from the repo root.

**Token Linter** -- `scripts/lint-tokens.ts` enforces CSS token usage across stylesheets, catching raw color and spacing values that should use design tokens instead.

## Validation Entry Points

Use the workspace scripts rather than package-local ad hoc commands:

```bash
bun format && bun lint
bun run test
bun run test:coverage
bun build
bun run validate list
bun run validate smoke
bun run validate core-loop
bun run validate:store-readiness
bun run validate:production-readiness
bun run validate:production-live-readiness
```
