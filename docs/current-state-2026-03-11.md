## Where Coop Is Right Now

Coop has moved through three distinct scopes in under two weeks:

1. The March 1 to March 3 architecture framed Coop as a broader browser-native coordination OS with four pillars, richer identity layers, hardware portability, and a larger long-term mesh model.
2. The March 5 and March 10 discussions narrowed that into a hackathon MVP centered on passive browser capture, explicit review, shared memory, capital formation, and anchor-node-backed inference.
3. The repo's current canonical `docs/coop-os-architecture-vnext.md` narrows v1 further: as of March 11, 2026, the extension is the real product surface and `packages/app` now carries both the landing page and the receiver PWA shell.

The codebase matches the third scope better than the earlier docs, but the dated notes now understate what shipped after March 11: the receiver PWA, board route, and bounded session-key work all exist in the current product slice.

## Completed

- Monorepo structure is in place with `packages/app`, `packages/extension`, and `packages/shared`.
- The extension has the expected MV3 surfaces: popup, sidepanel, background worker, manifest, runtime message bridge, and icon-state handling.
- Shared browser-local persistence exists through Dexie and Yjs document serialization.
- Passkey-first identity is implemented for local session creation and member projection.
- Coop creation is implemented, including setup insights, seed contribution, and Safe state resolution in mock or live mode.
- The onchain path is now standardized on `Ethereum Sepolia` for default test and development flows, with `Arbitrum One` available only when explicitly configured for production-oriented validation.
- Invite generation and join flows are implemented.
- Multi-profile peer sync exists through Yjs plus `y-webrtc`, with health reporting back into the extension UI.
- Passive capture exists for browser tabs, including extract shaping and heuristic local interpretation into review drafts.
- Review and publish flows exist, including cross-coop publish targets.
- Archive and export flows exist for artifacts, snapshots, and archive receipts.
- Automated validation already exists through Vitest and Playwright, including a full two-profile extension workflow.

## Incomplete Or Stubbed

- The receiver PWA exists and supports pairing, capture, inbox review, and cross-device private intake sync. The remaining work is production hardening and demo polish, not first implementation.
- The local enhancement path is still heuristic-first. WebLLM or any other real local model execution is not implemented.
- Trusted-node capability is mostly conceptual. The code distinguishes roles, but there is not yet a stronger operational anchor runtime beyond env-gated live integrations.
- Green Goods garden binding is not implemented and remains intentionally deferred until after the Arbitrum/Sepolia Safe path is stable.
- Archive upload delegation now runs inside trusted extension nodes in live mode and no longer depends on an external issuer service.
- Filecoin lifecycle tracking stops at receipt creation. Follow-up indexing or seal-status refresh is not implemented.
- Review ritual support exists only as grouped read views. There is no explicit weekly ritual scheduler, facilitator flow, or meeting-mode review surface.
- The identity model is simpler than the earliest architecture. Per-coop DID, signed CRDT envelopes, and richer transport/member/co-op identity separation are not in the current implementation.
- Multi-coop membership is present in data shape and publish routing, but the UX is still shallow. It does not yet feel passive and low-friction for people operating across several coops at once.

## Explicitly Out Of Scope Or No Longer Planned For Current V1

These items appear in earlier discussions, but the repo's locked v1 architecture now excludes them:

- Broader mobile-native surfaces beyond the current receiver PWA shell
- Transcript capture on mobile
- Local file or folder ingest
- PDF library ingest
- App-level capture outside the browser
- Full React Flow editing
- Full Green Goods garden binding
- Built-in API-key cloud LLM integrations
- Autonomous agent execution
- Open-ended session-key transaction flows outside the bounded Green Goods scope
- End-user skill management UI

The March 5 notes also explicitly removed Telegram and Bluesky from immediate hackathon scope. The March 10 notes keep those ideas alive as later trusted-node capabilities, but they are not part of the current build plan.

## Current App State

`packages/app` is a polished landing and onboarding surface plus the receiver PWA and board runtime.

What it does well:

- communicates the product story clearly
- exposes the four-lens setup ritual
- works on desktop and mobile layouts
- matches the locked v1 narrative in the architecture

What it still does not do yet:

- host the full extension-side review workflow
- replace the extension as the primary trusted-node surface
- act as the general member dashboard for every coop workflow

## Current Extension State

`packages/extension` is the real Coop product surface today.

Implemented product loop:

- create a coop
- create trusted or member invites
- join from a second browser profile
- manually round up tabs
- review and edit drafts in the Roost
- push drafts into shared coop memory
- sync published state between peers
- archive an artifact or snapshot
- export snapshot, artifact, and receipt bundles

What still feels prototype-level:

- relevance scoring is deterministic and lightweight, not meaningfully learned
- capture cadence is global, not coop-aware
- trust/anchor behavior is not yet operationally distinct
- error handling exists, but recovery UX is still basic
- the multi-coop workflow is technically present more than it is product-polished

## Best Next Phases For The Next Couple Of Days

### Phase 1: Tighten The Core Extension Loop

Focus on the extension path that already exists instead of expanding surfaces again.

- Improve empty, error, and recovery states in the sidepanel.
- Make multi-coop review more legible: active coop switching, publish-target clarity, and draft routing confidence.
- Add better state visibility around sync, archive mode, and live/mock integration mode.

### Phase 2: Validate The Real Integration Boundaries

Run the current mock loop until it is boring, then validate live edges one at a time.

- Live Safe creation on Arbitrum with Sepolia as the test path, and narrow the runtime to those two chain targets only.
- Live Storacha delegation and upload against a provisioned trusted extension node.
- Stable signaling for multi-profile sync outside the local demo environment.

### Phase 3: Add Just Enough Genericization

Do not genericize the whole brand. Genericize the underlying container model.

- Add a `space type` or `coop archetype` field to the shared profile.
- Keep the current community/co-op ritual as the default preset.
- Add additional presets later for `friends`, `family`, `project`, and `personal`.
- Preserve one common artifact model so all types still share the same capture, review, publish, and archive loop.

## How To Make Coop More Generic Without Losing The Current Direction

The safest path is not “replace coop with a generic workspace.” The safer path is “keep Coop as the membrane product, but let the membrane serve different relationship types.”

Recommended shape:

- `community`: current default; good for local chapters, co-ops, and networks
- `project`: lighter-weight temporary collaboration
- `friends`: casual shared curation and planning
- `family`: household memory, planning, and resource sharing
- `personal`: private cross-device note capture and synthesis for one person

To support that, the next architectural step should be:

1. add `spaceType` to the shared profile and onboarding flow
2. move setup lenses from hard-coded fields to preset packs
3. let personal mode default to one-member private sync first, then optional invite sharing later
4. keep the extension-first capture and archive machinery shared across every mode

The most compelling near-term genericization is `personal`. It directly matches your “you across devices” idea and lets Coop prove value even before a full group review ritual happens.

## Testing And Validation Read

The repo already has a solid base:

- unit and integration tests across shared logic
- desktop and mobile landing-page Playwright checks
- a strong extension E2E that covers create, join, sync, capture, publish, and archive

What was missing was a named validation entrypoint. That is now documented in `docs/testing-and-validation.md` and backed by `scripts/validate.mjs` so Codex can run targeted suites instead of only one broad `playwright test` command.
